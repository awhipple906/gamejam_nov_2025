PrinceThar: I'm alive, Moon's blessings.
PrinceThar: Am I underground? The crash must have breached a cave network.
PrinceThar: Huh?! My clothes are gone!

PrinceThar: At least I still have my helm and sword.
PrinceThar: I should find my way up to the surface. I don't think my ship is headed anywhere soon.
